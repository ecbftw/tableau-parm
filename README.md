# What is this?

tableau-parm is an small command line utility designed to interact with Tableau forensic write blockers. It performs functions similar to the Tableau Disk Monitor, except that it operates under select UNIX platforms.


# Where do I learn more?

See the [main project site](http://projects.sentinelchicken.org/tableau-parm/).  You'll find official releases there and more documentation.


# What if I have trouble?

Feel free to submit an issue here on GitHub.


# Is this project maintained anymore?

tableau-parm was developed for use with a variety of write blockers I had on hand nearly 9 years ago.  Since then, Tableau was acquired by Guidance Software and I'm not sure how much the host interface protocol has changed, if at all.  I'm certainly interested to hear about experiences with the newer blockers and will happily manage submitted patches, but I don't perform many investigations these days so I don't have my hands on the modern hardware right now.


# How do I contribute?

We love contributions.  However, for now this GitHub mirror is just that, a static mirror, so please don't submit pull requests.  Just submit an issue here on GitHub and I'll follow up with you to get your patches merged.
