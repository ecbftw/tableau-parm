tableau-parm Installation
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

This package doesn't require much for installation.  Just what typically
comes with any free operating system.  Be sure you have:

 - sg3_utils header files and libraries
     See: http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg3_utils.html
 - Linux or FreeBSD 
     Other platforms supported by sg3_utils may work, but haven't been tested
 - Make
 - GCC


Survival Commands
-----------------

make
# and as root
make install


Linux Notes
-----------

First ensure sg3_utils is installed.  

Under Debian, 'apt-get install sg3_utils' should be sufficient.
In general, you should see the following files available on your
system if you have the prerequisites installed correctly:
  /usr/lib/libsgutils.so
  /usr/include/scsi/sg_lib.h
  /usr/include/scsi/sg_pt.h

Tableau devices have only been tested over Firewire and USB.  You
should be able to run tableau-parm directly on disk devices, such as
/dev/sda.


FreeBSD Notes
-------------

First make sure your kernel supports the new SCSI generic (sg)
interface for SCSI devices.  During testing (which has only occurred
on FreeBSD 7.2-RELEASE), it was necessary to add the following lines
to the GENERIC kernel configuration:
  device          atapicam
  device          sg

Once you recompile and reboot, you should see two new devices named
'/dev/sg?' for each SCSI-like disk device on your system.  For
instance, on my test system, my main system disk had /dev/sg0 and
/dev/sga associated with it.  Adding a USB drive created /dev/da0 and
associated /dev/sg1 and /dev/sg0.  I don't yet know of a way to check
to find out what base device an sg? device is associated with.  In any
case, using tableau-parm on sgN devices (where N is an integer) and
directly on the base block device (such as /dev/da0) worked fine during
preliminary testing.

Once you have generic SCSI support, be sure sg3_utils is installed.
There's a port under /usr/ports/sysutils/sg3_utils for the package.
To ensure it is installed correctly, just check to make sure the
following files exist:
  /usr/local/lib/libsgutils.so
  /usr/local/include/scsi/sg_lib.h
  /usr/local/include/scsi/sg_pt.h


Advanced Installation
---------------------
To install in a custom directory, simply change one or more of the
following make variables to suit your needs:

 PREFIX      Top level install directory.  Used as base for rest unless
             they too are overridden. (This defaults to /usr/local)

 BIN_PREFIX  Location for executable programs to be installed.

 DOC_PREFIX  Location for documentation.

 MAN_PREFIX  A path in the MANPATH.


Use the following syntax (with GNU Make) to override a variable:

# as root
make VAR=value install


For more information, see the Makefiles.
